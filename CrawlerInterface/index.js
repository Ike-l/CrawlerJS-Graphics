 had BBox[0] for translating realised when logging everything and noticed that when the x and y were equal was when the bug occured
 tried every combinations
 even used an extension to see if the coords were where they were supposed to be
 was scared it was a logic error because tested my previous and it didnt work but i fixed that bug at same time apparently
 - bug was when width != height the scale would move wrongly
